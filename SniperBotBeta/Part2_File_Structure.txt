Part 2: File Structure and Interactions

Required Files for the Project
------------------------------
1. main.py: The entry point of the bot, orchestrates event scanning and trading execution.
2. config.json: Stores user-specific configurations, including keys, addresses, and trade parameters.
3. scanner.py: Handles blockchain event scanning and filtering.
4. trader.py: Executes trades based on the events detected by scanner.py.
5. logger.py: Logs all activities, including successful trades, errors, and performance metrics.

Interaction Between Files
-------------------------
- main.py calls scanner.py to monitor blockchain events.
- Relevant events are passed to trader.py for analysis and trade execution.
- trader.py retrieves parameters from config.json and logs results to logger.py.
- logger.py writes logs to a file for user review and debugging.

Basic Functionality of Each File
--------------------------------
- main.py: Coordinates all modules, initializes configurations, and manages the bot's lifecycle.
- config.json: Allows users to define trading parameters such as gas, slippage, and funds.
- scanner.py: Connects with blockchain APIs or WebSocket endpoints to track events in real-time.
- trader.py: Calculates trade details and sends transactions to the blockchain.
- logger.py: Ensures that all actions are documented for transparency and troubleshooting.
