Concept of the Sniper Bot
-------------------------
The Sniper Bot is a highly specialized tool designed for automated trading in cryptocurrency markets. Its primary purpose is to scan blockchain events, identify profitable trading opportunities, and execute trades with parameters optimized for speed, efficiency, and profitability.

Features
--------
- Event Scanning: Monitors blockchain events, such as token launches or liquidity pool updates, to identify trading opportunities.
- Automated Trading: Executes trades based on predefined parameters, including slippage tolerance, gas fees, and allocation of funds.
- Customization: Allows users to configure keys, addresses, and trading parameters for tailored usage.
- Real-Time Analytics: Provides insights and logs for each transaction, enabling users to track performance.

Summary of How It Works
------------------------
1. The bot scans blockchain events using APIs or WebSocket connections.
2. When a trading opportunity is detected, it evaluates the event based on user-defined parameters.
3. The bot prepares and sends a transaction to the blockchain with optimized gas and slippage settings.
4. It logs the results of the transaction, including profit/loss and execution time.
