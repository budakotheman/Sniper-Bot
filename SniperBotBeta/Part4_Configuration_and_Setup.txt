Part 4: Configuration and Setup

Instructions for Configuration
------------------------------
1. Configuring Addresses and Keys:
   - Open the config.json file.
   - Add your blockchain wallet address under the walletAddress field.
   - Add your private key in the privateKey field. Make sure to keep this file secure.

2. Setting API Keys:
   - If the bot requires interaction with blockchain APIs (e.g., Infura, Alchemy), obtain your API key from the respective service provider.
   - Add the API key to the apiKey field in config.json.

3. Network Configuration:
   - Specify the blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain) under the network field in config.json.
   - Define the RPC URL for the network.

Finding Addresses and Keys
--------------------------
- Wallet Address: Use a wallet like MetaMask to find your public address.
- Private Key: Export it from your wallet application. Be cautious and avoid sharing this key.
- API Keys: Visit the official websites of services like Infura or Alchemy and follow their instructions to generate an API key.

Example of config.json
----------------------
{
  "walletAddress": "0xYourWalletAddress",
  "privateKey": "YourPrivateKey",
  "apiKey": "YourAPIKey",
  "network": "Ethereum Mainnet",
  "gasFee": "50",
  "slippageTolerance": "1",
  "tradeAllocation": "0.1"
}

Security Tips
-------------
- Never share your private key publicly.
- Use encrypted storage for the config.json file.
- Regularly rotate API keys to maintain security.
